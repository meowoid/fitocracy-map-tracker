fitocracy-map-tracker
=====================

A mobile-device accesible web application that displays your current location 
on a map, and then allows you to select a fitocracy.com exercise task to start 
tracking (eg: walk, jog, hike, run, bike ride). Once the task is selected, the 
application keeps track of your speed/distance/path as you are exercising. 
As you are going along, display the path you've taken on the map. Start the map 
at max-zoom, then zoom out as the path taken goes past the viewport of the 
current-zoom-level. When the user ends the task, the relevant details 
(speed, distance, pace) are uploaded to fitocaracy.
